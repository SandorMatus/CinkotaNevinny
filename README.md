## HOW TO LAUNCH
Download repository, compile HackTheBank if it is not already compiled and run.

### Exploits
Exploit 1 : Find password. This can be done multiple ways. 
  - By examining code with Ghidra or other decompiler (GL with that).
  - By brute forcing (Hint: there are 10 symbols, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers), that should take a while.
  - Some other way TBA :)

Exploit 2 : Wow you got in. Use integer overflow by adding the before mentioned password to the python script "Integer-Overflow.py" and watch what happens.

Exploit 3 : Not so different then 2. Use buffer overflow by adding the before mentioned password to the python script "Buffer-Overflow.py" and watch what happens.

### Enjoy
